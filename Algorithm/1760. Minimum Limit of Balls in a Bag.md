Used the [[C++ max_element]] to find the maximum element in short code.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int maxOperations) {
        int l = 1, r = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int ans = r;
        while (l <= r) {
            int maybeAns = (l + r) / 2, operations = 0;
            for (int num : nums) operations += (num - 1) / maybeAns;
            if (operations > maxOperations) l = maybeAns + 1;
            else r = maybeAns - 1, ans = maybeAns;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
