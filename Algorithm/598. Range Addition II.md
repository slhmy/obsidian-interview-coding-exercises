The problem seems to be hard to solve.
But if you read the statement carefully, you will find that the problem is actually very simple.
Every `ops` area starts from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`,
and we only need to find the most covered area at the end.

In code implementation, this problem examines you on how to iterate an array.
Iterate the `ops` array with a modern usage of [[C++ `for` grammar]] can be a good practice.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCount(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& ops) {
        if (ops.size() == 0) return m*n;

        int minM = m, minN = n;
        for (vector<int>& op : ops) {
            minM = min(op[0], minM);
            minN = min(op[1], minN);
        }
        return minM * minN;
    }
};
```
