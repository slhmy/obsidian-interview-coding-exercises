Basic palindrome checking problem with a little twist.
There maybe one character that can be removed to make the string a palindrome,
so when we find a mismatch, we need to skip one of the left or the right character to continue the check.
This policy can be easily implemented by iterating through the string two times,
one skipping the left character and the other skipping the right character.

But since **palindrome has sub-palindromes inside** (e.g. "abba" has "bb" as a sub-palindrome),
we can check the sub-palindrome by skipping the left or the right character.
**A helper function to check if the sub-string is a palindrome can simplify the code.**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validPalindromeInRange(string& s, int start, int end) {
        for (int l = start, r = end; l < r; l++, r--)
            if (s[l] != s[r])
                return false;
        return true;
    }

    bool validPalindrome(string s) {
        for (int l = 0, r = s.size() - 1; l < r; l++, r--)
            if (s[l] != s[r])
                return validPalindromeInRange(s, l, r - 1) ||
                       validPalindromeInRange(s, l + 1, r);
        return true;
    }
};
```
